Nextflow hands-on

During this tutorial you will implement a proof of concept of a RNA-Seq pipeline which:
1. Indexes a trascriptome file.
2. Performs quality controls
3. Performs quantification.
4. Create a MultiqQC report.

## Step 1 - define the pipeline parameters

The script ```script1.nf``` defines the pipeline input parameters. Run it by using the following command:
```nextflow run script1.nf```
